# xyz/physics example

This demo shows how to construct and visualize a [physics](../../physics) model of a simple virtual room environment, with a virtual robot ("emer") having a first-person view of the world.

You can hold down the motion buttons in the toolbar to move the robot around more easily.

Use `-nogui` arg to run in no GUI mode (purely offscreen mode, e.g., for batch-mode running), which saves a .png image of the starting view, in `eyer_0.png`.
