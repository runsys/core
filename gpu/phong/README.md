# Phong is a Blinn-Phong rendering system in gpu

Blinn-Phong is a standard lighting model that used to be built into OpenGL, and is widely used in 3D graphics: [wikipedia Blinn-Phong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn%E2%80%93Phong_shading_model),  [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Basic-Lighting).

This package provides a "middleware" layer between the basic `gpu` package and a complete end-user framework like [xyz](https://github.com/cogentcore/core/tree/main/xyz) which can focus on how to organize the scenegraph data structures, and then relies on `phong` to mange the gpu-side rendering efficiently.


# Usage

Phong uses the "Set and Reset" paradigm for all resources, which is generally suited to most 3D use-cases.  Meshes, Textures and Objects must be `Set` before they are used in a render pass (and further `Set` calls with the same unique name id just update existing properties).  There is no further Config call or anything: everything is dynamically updated in the Set call.  Note that the Phong object must have been created with an active GPU instance and renderer, before calling any Set calls.

If there is any drastic change to the overall scene configuration, Reset removes all of the existing items.  Otherwise, any unused items just take up space on the GPU, but do not incur additional runtime costs.  

See [examples/phong] for a working example.

```Go
    // needs a gpu.GPU, and a gpu.Renderer, e.g., the gpu.Surface
    ph := phong.NewPhong(sf.GPU, sf)
    
    // add lights
    ph.AddDirectional(math32.NewVector3Color(color.White), math32.Vec3(0, 1, 1))
    ...
    
    // add meshes
    ph.SetMesh("sphere", shape.NewSphere(.5, 64))
    ...
    
    // set textures
    ph.SetTexture(fn, phong.NewTexture(imgs[i])) // go image.Image, ideally RGBA
    ...

    // set objects
    ph.SetObject(nm, phong.NewObject(&ob.Matrix, ob.Color, color.Black, 30, 1, 1))
    ...
    
    // set the camera matricies
    ph.SetCamera(view, projection)
    
    ph.Config() // configures everything for current settings -- only call once
    
    // can call ph.ConfigMeshes(), ph.ConfigTextures(), ph.ConfigLights()
    // to update any of those elements if they change

    // render, to a surface:
    rp, err := ph.RenderStart() // uploads updated object data too
    for i, ob := range objects {
        ph.UseObjectIndex(i)
        ph.UseMeshName(ob.Mesh)
        if ob.Texture != "" {
            ph.UseTextureName(ob.Texture)
        } else {
            ph.UseNoTexture()
        }
    }
    ph.RenderEnd(rp)
```

# Features

Supports 4 different types of lights, with a max of 8 instances of each light type:

* `Ambient`: light emitted from everywhere -- provides a background of diffuse light bouncing around in all directions.

* `Directional`: light directed along a given vector (specified as a position of a light shining toward the origin), with no attenuation.  This is like the sun.

* `Point`: an omnidirectional light with a position and associated decay factors, which divide the light intensity as a function of linear and quadratic distance.  The quadratic factor dominates at longer distances.light radiating out in all directdions from a specific point, 

* `Spot`: a light with a position and direction and associated decay factors and angles, which divide the light intensity as a function of linear and quadratic distance. The quadratic factor dominates at longer distances.

Meshes are indexed triangles.

There are 3 rendering pipelines:
* OneColor: a single color for the entire mesh.
* Texture: color comes from texture image
* PerVertex: color is provided per vertex by the mesh.

The color model has the following factors:
* `Color` = main color of surface arising from one of the 3 sources listed above, used for both ambient and diffuse color in standard Phong model.  The alpha component determines transparency.  Note that transparent objects require more complex rendering, to sort objects as a function of depth.
* `Emissive` = color that surface emits independent of any lighting, i.e., glow, can be used for marking lights with an object.
* `Shiny` = specular shininess factor, which determines how focally the surface shines back directional light. This is an exponential factor, where 0 = very broad diffuse reflection, and higher values (typically max of 128) have a smaller more focal specular reflection. Default is 30.
* `Reflect` = reflectiveness of the surface in the region where specular reflected light is emitted, where 1 = full shiny white reflection (specular) color and 0 = no shine reflection.  The specular color is always set to white, which will reflect the light color accurately.
* `Bright` = overall multiplier on final computed color value. Can be used to tune the overall brightness of various surfaces relative to each other for a given set of lighting parameters.

# Layout of Vars

Without push constants in WebGPU, we maintain an `Objects` group with per-object dynamic offset data, that is selected with the `UseObject*` function on each render step.  This means that the phong system must know about all the objects in advance.
