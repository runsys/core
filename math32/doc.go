// math32 is our version of the G3N math32 32-bit, 3D rendering-based
// math library.

//
// A major modification from the G3N version is to use value-based
// logic instead of pointer-based self-modification in the Vector classes,
// As used in e.g., go-gl/mathgl (which uses slice-based vectors instead
// of the more intuitive and likely more efficient struct-based ones here).
//
// The pointer-based approach was retained for the Matrix classes,
// which are larger and that is likely more performant.
//
// Many names were shortened, consistent with more idiomatic Go naming.
// and again with the go-gl/mathgl library
