# vecint

Package `vecint` has vector types for emergent, including `Vector2i` which is a 2D vector with int values, using the API based on `math32.Vector2i`. This is distinct from math32.Vector2i because it uses int instead of int32, and the int is significantly easier to deal with for layer sizing params etc.
