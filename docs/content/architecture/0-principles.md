# Principles

This page contains a list of fundamental principles that Cogent Core is built on. There are occasional exceptions to these principles, but they should be followed almost all of the time, and there must be a very clear reason for not following them.

# Code is always the best solution

A common approach to programming, especially for the web, is to reduce the amount of actual programming that takes place and instead use simplified markup, configuration, and selection formats like CSS, HTML, YAML, and Regex. The promise of this is that you will be able to accomplish everything you need to do in a very easy, simple way. However, there are several problems with this strategy. First, it requires learning many different languages, typically with very magic syntaxes packed with random symbols that do various things, with no clear connection between the symbols and the actions. Second of all, the simplified formats never end up covering all use cases, resulting in hacky workarounds to achieve the desired functionality, or, in some cases, entirely new languages that promise to cover all of the use cases, for real this time.

The eventual result of this trend is that people end up stuffing entire programming languages into these supposedly simple formats to cover their requirements (for example, SCSS, JSX, and templates). The resulting languages are neither simple, clear, nor extensible, creating massive amounts of unreadable and inefficient code. This means that everyone has to learn these languages and their magic syntaxes, struggle to read their complicated code, reach their inevitable limits in functionality, and suffer runtime errors and bad performance due to the typically duck-typed, interpreted nature of these languages.

The solution to this is simple: whenever possible, everything should be written in real code, preferably in one language. Therefore, Cogent Core takes this approach: everything, from trees to widgets to styling to enums, is written in real, pure Go code. The only non-Go functional files in a Cogent Core package or app should be TOML files, which are only used for very simple configuration options to commands, and not for any actual code.

# Go is the best programming language (for GUIs)

There are many programming languages, and each one represents a different set of tradeoffs.  We think that Go is the best language (for GUIs and most other use-cases) according to the following list of fundamental characteristics:

### Type safety and compilation

One of the most important features of a programming language is type safety. Type safety and compilation give helpful compile-time errors, code completion, and syntax highlighting that make code safe and readable. This requirement eliminates many popular languages like JavaScript and Python, where it is common for simple bugs to lurk unnoticed until each line of code is executed at runtime.

### Simplicity and elegance

Code must be *simple* to write. Humans must read and write code, and it is much easier to read and write code with simple, semantic, and consistent operations, not symbol soup like that found in Regex, SCSS, and Rust macros (what does `($($($([` do?). Humans should not have to waste time writing semicolons and parentheses around their `if` conditions. Humans should not have to redundantly repeat the type of something (`Something something = Something{};`). Type safety should make code safe, not intricate and verbose. This condition eliminates many compiled languages like Rust and C++ (note: Rust and C++ are useful for certain things like operating system kernels and graphics drivers, but this is about end-user GUI development).

### Speed

Programs must be quick to write, compile, and run. Most compiled languages fail the first and second conditions, and most interpreted languages fail the last. Go can be written extremely quickly due to its simple and elegant syntax, it compiles in seconds even for complex GUIs, and there is no runtime performance deficit significant enough to impact GUIs.

### Cross-platform and cross-compilation

Every widely used platform should be well supported, and to the greatest extent possible, the exact same code should work as expected on every platform.  Furthermore, because Go's compiler is written in Go, it is relatively straightforward to cross-compile for other platforms.  By contrast, JavaScript has to deal with the notorious inconsistency across different browsers, and because most of Python requires further C / C++ code to be compiled (to manage the performance-critical aspects), it is often a nightmare to manage all the dependencies and environment variables required to get something to work on a given platform, at the right version, etc.

### Robust versioning and package management

Go's `module` based versioning and package management system is built into the language, and is extremely robust and simple to use.  By contrast, dependencies and package management in JavaScript and Python is notoriously bad.

### Rationality and consistency

Languages must be rational and consistent both internally and with other programming languages. If other programming languages use `object.Method(args)` to call a method, and you use `function(args)` to call a function, then maybe you should not use `[object method:args]` to call methods (Objective-C). `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` may help you vent frustration at the terrible programming language you are using, but it is not good for clean and readable code. If `10+"1"` is `"101"`, then maybe `10-"1"` shouldn't be `9` (JavaScript). Two of the most core operations in a programming language, `var` and `==`, should not be semantically incorrect and require the use of alternative operators instead, `let` and `===` (also JavaScript).

# Struct fields are better than maps for things like configuration and styling

Configuration settings, typically settable with a config file and / or command-line arguments, are stored as key-value maps in the widely used [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), viper and other such tools.  Likewise, in v1 of core, styling was set using Properties maps.

However, using a `struct` with appropriately named fields has the following advantages:
* Compile time name-safety: the compiler ensures you didn't mistype the key name.
* Compile time type-safety: the type of the property is not `any` but the actual type needed.
* Tab completion and full lookup in IDEs -- much easier when _using_ config values in an app, and also when setting styling in GUI.
* GUI editor of config opts as a Form has full access to field tag GUI hints, etc.
* [[types]] can provide access to field comments for full docs for each option, whereas the map implementation requires separate maps of docs and values.

This is why the [[cli]] configuration and app command management system is based structs, and v2 of core uses "direct styling" functions that directly set values on the `styles.Style` style structs.

# Generate instead of `reflect`

Generated code is faster and cleaner and can be targeted to just what is needed.  `reflect` should be reserved for things like `core.Form` and other such views which need to be truly generic and operate on any kind of type from any package, etc.

# Interfaces instead of `reflect`

Interfaces go hand-in-hand with generated code: the boilerplate code that satisfies the interfaces is auto-generated as needed.

The prototype here is [[enums]]

# Packages should be small, focused, and minimal

Find the coherent chunks of functionality and encapsulate them in separate packages, instead of creating sprawling mega-packages like `ki` was before.  Now that we know all the functionality we need, we can think more carefully about how to package it.

Try to make these packages as independent as possible; don't have them depend on other infrastructure unless absolutely necessary, so that they can be used by anyone in an unencumbered way.

This is what we look for, in considering whether to import a given package, so it is what we should provide.

Examples:
* [[colors]] pulled out of core
* [[reflectx]] pulled reflection stuff out of tree
* [[clicore]] separated from [[cli]] to keep cli free of core dependency

# Use function libraries instead of putting lots of methods on a type

Go uses the `strings` package instead of adding a lot of builtin methods on the `string` type.  The advantages are:
* More flexibility to add and change implementations; can even have a replacement implementation with the same signatures.
* Multiple different such packages can be used for different subsets of functionality (e.g., regex, unicode etc are all separate).
* Type itself remains small and only handles most basic functionality -- presumably this works better for checking Interface implementation etc.

Consistent with this approach, [[colors]] implements functions operating on the standard `color.RGBA` data type, instead of the many methods we defined on `gist.Color` in V1.

# Collections are plural

Packages and types whose primary purpose is to describe/hold a collection of something should be named in the plural. For example, [[events]] holds a collection of different event types, so it has a plural name. Also, per this rule, enum types are almost always named in the plural, as they describe a collection of possible values.
