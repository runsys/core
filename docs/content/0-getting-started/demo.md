# Running the demo

You can run the Cogent Core Demo in two different ways:

1. Go to [cogentcore.org/core/demo](https://cogentcore.org/core/demo)
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/cogentcore/core && cd core/examples/demo && core run`

Both of those options should create a window/tab similar to the one below:
