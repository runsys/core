Cogent Core provides an inspector that allows you to view and edit the contents of an app. To open the inspector, simply press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (`Cmd+Shift+I` on macOS). You can also open the inspector by pressing the `Inspect` button in the top app bar overflow menu.

Inside of the inspector, there is a tree of widgets and a display of the properties of the currently selected widget. You can select an element using the tree or the `Select element` button, which allows you to select an element in the inspector by clicking on it in the app.

You can edit most widget properties in the inspector, including the styles of a widget once you turn `Override style` on. The [tooltips](../basic/tooltips) of the various properties contain useful information, and the `Geom` is critical for debugging layout issues.

The `Debug` section of the `Settings` is also useful for debugging any low-level issues.
