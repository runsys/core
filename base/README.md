# base

A collection of base infrastructure packages that serve as a base for the main Cogent Core packages. They are placed in this directory to avoid cluttering the root directory with small packages that are not the main focus of Cogent Core. In a sense, these packages are extensions of the Go standard library that could have been plausibly included there.
