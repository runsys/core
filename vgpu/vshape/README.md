# vshape: Compositional 3D shape library

`vshape` provides a library of 3D shapes, built from indexed triangle meshes, which can be added together in `ShapeGroup` lists.  Each `Shape` can report the number of points and indexes based on configured parameters, and keeps track of its offset within an overall `math32.ArrayF32` allocated based on total numbers.  In this way, separate Allocate then Configure phases are supported, as required by the vgpu Memory allocation system.

It only has a dependency on the [math32](https://cogentcore.org/core/math32) package and could be used for anything.

Basic building blocks (e.g., Plane, SphereSector) have standalone methods, in addition to Shape elements.

Here are the shapes:

* Plane
* Box
* Sphere (including various partial segments thereof)
* Cylinder, Cone (including different size top and bottom radii, e.g., Cones)
* Capsule: a cylinder with half-sphere caps -- good for simple body segments
