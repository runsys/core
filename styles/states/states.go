	// Invisible elements are not displayed, and thus do not present
	// a target for GUI events.  It is identical to css display:none.
	// This can also be set when the item is out of visible display
	// as in scrolling or collapsing elements.
	// Elements can be made visible by toggling this flag and thus
	// in general should be constructed and styled, but a new layout
	// step must generally be taken after visibility status has changed.

	// Disabled elements cannot be interacted with or selected,
	// but do display.
	Disabled

	// ReadOnly elements cannot be changed, but can be selected.
	// A text input must not be ReadOnly for entering text.
	// A button can be pressed while ReadOnly -- if not ReadOnly then
	// the label on the button can be edited, for example.
	ReadOnly

	// Selected elements have been marked for clipboard or other such actions.
	Selected

	// Active elements are currently being interacted with,
	// usually involving a mouse button being pressed in the element.
	// A text field will be active while being clicked on, and this
	// can also result in a Focused state.
	// If further movement happens, an element can also end up being
	// Dragged or Sliding.
	Active

	// Dragging means this element is currently being dragged
	// by the mouse (i.e., a MouseDown event followed by MouseMove),
	// as part of a drag-n-drop sequence.
	Dragging

	// Sliding means this element is currently being manipulated
	// via mouse to change the slider state, which will continue
	// until the mouse is released, even if it goes off the element.
	// It should also still be Active.
	Sliding

	// Focused elements receive keyboard input.
	Focused

	// Checked is for check boxes or radio buttons or other similar state.
	Checked

	// Indeterminate indicates that the true state of an item is unknown.
	// For example, [Checked] state items may be in an uncertain state
	// if they represent other checked items, some of which are checked
	// and some of which are not.
	Indeterminate

	// Hovered indicates that a mouse pointer has entered the space over
	// an element, but it is not Active (nor DragHovered).
	Hovered

	// LongHovered indicates a Hover event that persists without significant
	// movement for a minimum period of time (e.g., 500 msec),
	// which typically triggers a tooltip popup.
	LongHovered

	// LongPressed indicates a MouseDown event that persists without significant
	// movement for a minimum period of time (e.g., 500 msec),
	// which typically triggers a tooltip and/or context menu popup.
	LongPressed

	// DragHovered indicates that a mouse pointer has entered the space over
	// an element during a drag-n-drop sequence.  This makes it a candidate
	// for a potential drop target.
