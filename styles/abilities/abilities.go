	Editable Abilities = iota

	// Selectable means it can be Selected
	Selectable

	// Activatable means it can be made Active by pressing down on it,
	// which gives it a visible state layer color change.
	// This also implies Clickable, receiving Click events when
	// the user executes a mouse down and up event on the same element.
	Activatable

	// Clickable means it can be Clicked, receiving Click events when
	// the user executes a mouse down and up event on the same element,
	// but otherwise does not change its rendering when pressed
	// (as Activatable does).  Use this for items that are more passively
	// clickable, such as frames or tables, whereas e.g., a Button is
	// Activatable.
	Clickable

	// DoubleClickable indicates that an element does something different
	// when it is clicked on twice in a row.
	DoubleClickable

	// TripleClickable indicates that an element does something different
	// when it is clicked on three times in a row.
	TripleClickable

	// click events when the pointer is held down on it.
	RepeatClickable

	// to change value.  Cannot be both Draggable and Slideable.
	Slideable

	// Checkable means it can be Checked
	Checkable

	// Scrollable means it can be Scrolled
	Scrollable

	// Focusable means it can be Focused: capable of receiving and processing key events directly
	// and typically changing the style when focused to indicate this property to the user.
	Focusable

	// Hoverable means it can be Hovered
	Hoverable

	// LongHoverable means it can be LongHovered
	LongHoverable
