Package Units supports full range of CSS-style length units (em, px, dp, etc)

The unit is stored along with a value, and can be converted at a later point into
a raw display pixel value using the Context which contains all the necessary reference
values to perform the conversion.  Typically the unit value is parsed early from a style
and then converted later once the context is fully resolved.  The Value also holds the
converted value (Dots) so it can be used directly without further re-conversion.

'Dots' are used as term for underlying raw display pixels because "Pixel" and the px unit
are actually not conventionally used as raw display pixels in the current HiDPI
environment.  See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/length: 1 px = 1/96 in
Also supporting dp = density-independent pixel = 1/160 in
