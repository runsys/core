// Lang provides a general interface for language-specific management
// of the lexing, parsing, and symbol lookup process.
// The lexer and parser machinery is entirely language-general
// but specific languages may need specific ways of managing these
// processes, and processing their outputs, to best support the
// features of those languages.  That is what this interface provides.
//
// Each language defines a type supporting this interface, which is
// in turn registered with the StdLangProperties map.  Each supported
// language has its own .go file in this parse package that defines its
// own implementation of the interface and any other associated
// functionality.
//
// The Lang is responsible for accessing the appropriate pi.Parser for this
// language (initialized and managed via LangSupport.OpenStandard() etc)
// and the pi.FileState structure contains all the input and output
// state information for a given file.
//
// This interface is likely to evolve as we expand the range of supported
// languages.
