Package parse is the top-level package for the Cogent Core parsing system.

The code is organized into the various sub-packages, dealing with the different
stages of parsing etc.

Sub-package languages has the parsers for specific languages, including Go (of course), markdown
and tex (latter are lexer-only)

Note that the GUI editor framework for creating and testing parsers is currently
in the piv subpackage in Cogent Code: https://github.com/cogentcore/cogent/tree/main/code/piv
